Fivereborn Webmanager
==============

How to use:
--------------

Edit the index.php like you need it. Change Sitename and add Servers. Upload it to your webserver and have fun.


IMPORTANT:
--------------

You can integrate it in you own website or build around that script but its completly insecure by default. Everybody could just google your site and ban players. You MUST add some sort of security feature to it, like a login system.
Again, please dont use it like it is now!!!!
